Implement a program to import student data into a database, and then produce class rosters.

$ python import.py characters.csv
$ python roster.py Gryffindor

Lavender Brown, born 1979
Colin Creevey, born 1981
Seamus Finnigan, born 1979
Hermione Jean Granger, born 1979
Neville Longbottom, born 1980
Parvati Patil, born 1979
Harry James Potter, born 1980
Dean Thomas, born 1980
Romilda Vane, born 1981
Ginevra Molly Weasley, born 1981
Ronald Bilius Weasley, born 1980
Getting Started
Here’s how to download this problem into your own CS50 IDE. Log into CS50 IDE and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the below.

Execute cd to ensure that you’re in ~/ (i.e., your home directory, aka ~).
If you haven’t already, execute mkdir pset7 to make (i.e., create) a directory called pset7 in your home directory.
Execute cd pset7 to change into (i.e., open) that directory.
Execute wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/psets/7/houses/houses.zip to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem’s distribution.
Execute unzip houses.zip to uncompress that file.
Execute rm houses.zip followed by yes or y to delete that ZIP file.
Execute ls. You should see a directory called houses, which was inside of that ZIP file.
Execute cd houses to change into that directory.
Execute ls. You should see a characters.csv file and a students.db database.
Background
Hogwarts is in need of a student database. For years, the professors have been maintaing a CSV file containing all of the students’ names and houses and years. But that file didn’t make it particularly easy to get access to certain data, such as a roster of all the Ravenclaw students, or an alphabetical listing of the students enrolled at the school.

The challenge ahead of you is to import all of the school’s data into a SQLite database, and write a Python program to query that database to get house rosters for each of the houses of Hogwarts.

Specification
In import.py, write a program that imports data from a CSV spreadsheet.

Your program should accept the name of a CSV file as a command-line argument.
If the incorrect number of command-line arguments are provided, your program should print an error and exit.
You may assume that the CSV file will exist, and will have columns name, house, and birth.
For each student in the CSV file, insert the student into the students table in the students.db database.
While the CSV file provided to you has just a name column, the database has separate columns for first, middle, and last names. You’ll thus want to first parse each name and separate it into first, middle, and last names. You may assume that each person’s name field will contain either two space-separated names (a first and last name) or three space-separated names (a first, middle, and last name). For students without a middle name, you should leave their middle name field as NULL in the table.
In roster.py, write a program that prints a list of students for a given house in alphabetical order.

Your program should accept the name of a house as a command-line argument.
If the incorrect number of command-line arguments are provided, your program should print an error and exit.
Your program should query the students table in the students.db database for all of the students in the specified house.
Your program should then print out each student’s full name and birth year (formatted as, e.g., Harry James Potter, born 1980 or Luna Lovegood, born 1981).
Each student should be printed on their own line.
Students should be ordered by last name. For students with the same last name, they should be ordered by first name.
Walkthrough

Usage
Your program should behave per the example below:

$ python import.py characters.csv
$ python roster.py Gryffindor
Hermione Jean Granger, born 1979
Harry James Potter, born 1980
Ginevra Molly Weasley, born 1981
Ronald Bilius Weasley, born 1980
...
Hints
Recall that after you’ve imported SQL from cs50, you can set up a database connection using syntax like
db = SQL("sqlite:///students.db")
Then, you can use db.execute to execute SQL queries from inside of your Python script.

Recall that when you call db.execute and perform a SELECT query, the return value will be a list of rows that are returned, where each row is represented by a Python dict.
